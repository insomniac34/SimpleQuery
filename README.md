SimpleQuery
===========

A command line application for executing and retrieving Oracle queries from a remote database. Motivation was threefold:

1.) To avoid directly using the horribly slow class server in CS1555 (DB Systems)
2.) To learn the ins & outs of the Java/Oracle API
3.) To learn basic encryption of locally stored sensitive data (passwords/server details)
